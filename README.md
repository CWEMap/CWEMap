> **CWEMap: Graph-Guided Reasoning for Fine-Grained CWE Classification of Security Patches**

![CWEMap Approach Overview](https://github.com/CWEMap/CWEMap/blob/d5f697b026bbc702f28bb528c013e9ed04648087/CWEMap.png?raw=true)

The replication package supports the experiments reported in the manuscript, including dataset preprocessing, execution scripts, cross-backbone generalizability evaluation, and efficiency analysis.

## 🧭 1. Framework Overview

CWEMap follows a four-stage graph-guided workflow for fine-grained commit-level CWE classification: it retrieves relevant historical cases, constructs phase-aware patch graphs, aligns structurally compatible evidence, and decodes a valid CWE path over the frozen CWE taxonomy graph.

### 🔎 Phase 1: Patch-Aware Vulnerability Retrieval (PVR)
Retrieves top-k patch-relevant historical cases from a leakage-free training corpus after removing label-revealing metadata.

### 🧱 Phase 2: Phase-Aware Patch Graph Construction (PGC)
Extracts security triples from the target patch and retrieved cases, then builds phase-aware graphs using `T_before`, `T_delta`, and `T_after`. The target graph is `G_input`, and retrieved reference graphs form `KG_examples`.

### 🔗 Phase 3: Agent-Based Evidence Alignment (AEA)
Aligns `G_input` with `KG_examples` through constrained subgraph matching and evidence scoring to produce the graph-aligned package `Z`.

### 🌳 Phase 4: Agent-Based Hierarchical Reasoning (AHR)
Performs top-down decoding over `G_CWE` to predict a taxonomy-consistent terminal CWE path, with confidence-guided refinement when needed.

## 📊 Datasets

We evaluate **CWEMap** on two public vulnerability benchmarks: **TREEVUL** [1] and **PRIMEVUL** [2].

The dataset and preprocessing scripts are available in [`Dataset_Preprocessing/`](./Dataset_Preprocessing).

**TREEVUL** contains real-world security patches annotated with hierarchical CWE paths, making it suitable for evaluating fine-grained commit-level vulnerability type classification.

**PRIMEVUL** is a large-scale vulnerability benchmark collected from multiple open-source ecosystems. It covers 140 Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) classes among vulnerability-labeled training instances; in CWEMap, CWE-path evaluation is conducted only on vulnerability-labeled samples with valid CWE annotations.

The datasets are publicly available through Google Drive below.
