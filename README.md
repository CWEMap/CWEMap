# 🛠️ CWEMap: Graph-Guided Reasoning for Fine-Grained CWE Classification of Security Patches

This repository contains the replication package for **CWEMap**, the framework proposed in our ICSE submission:

> **CWEMap: Graph-Guided Reasoning for Fine-Grained CWE Classification of Security Patches**

CWEMap addresses fine-grained commit-level Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) classification by combining patch-evolution evidence, structurally similar historical vulnerability cases, and taxonomy-aware hierarchical reasoning. Instead of directly classifying raw patch text, CWEMap abstracts vulnerability-fixing commits into phase-aware patch graphs, aligns them with retrieved historical vulnerability cases, and performs constrained top-down prediction over the CWE taxonomy.

The replication package supports the experiments reported in the ICSE manuscript, including effectiveness comparison, ablation analysis, cross-backbone generalizability, and efficiency analysis.

## 🧭 1. Framework Overview

Given a vulnerability-fixing commit, CWEMap operates across four core stages:

### 🔍 Phase 1: Patch-Aware Vulnerability Retrieval (PVR)
Retrieves patch-relevant historical vulnerability cases from the training corpus while strictly preventing train-test data leakage.

### 🌿 Phase 2: Phase-Aware Patch Graph Construction (PGC)
Converts each raw code patch into phase-aware security triples:
* `T_before`: Vulnerable pre-patch state
* `T_delta`: Repair transformation
* `T_after`: Mitigated post-patch state

### 🤝 Phase 3: Agent-Based Evidence Alignment (AEA)
Aligns target patch graphs with retrieved reference graphs using constrained subgraph matching and multi-dimensional evidence scoring.

### 🧠 Phase 4: Agent-Based Hierarchical Reasoning (AHR)
Performs taxonomy-constrained CWE path prediction and confidence-guided refinement over the hierarchical CWE structure.

> **Key Innovation:** Unlike traditional approaches that rely solely on lexical patch similarity or unconstrained direct LLM prompting, CWEMap grounds its CWE predictions in explicit, graph-mapped patch semantics and valid structural taxonomy paths.
